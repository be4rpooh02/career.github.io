  <mark>Spark, Hadoop, AirFlow</mark> 기반의 ETL 배치 파이프라인 개발 경험이 있는 <mark>데이터 엔지니어</mark>입니다. <mark>악성코드 침해사고 대응</mark>으로 2010년부터 커리어를 시작하여 8년의 경험이 있으며, 침해사고 예방을 위한 <mark>에반젤리스트</mark>로도 활동했습니다.<br>
  **활성 단말 2,500만대**의 안티바이러스 제품이 수집한 데이터를 통합하는 **ETL 파이프라인을 개발**하여 인공지능 모델 학습과 제품 적용에 기여했습니다.<br>
  현재는 침해사고 대응 부서에서 **빅데이터 플랫폼**을 구축하여, 방치 된 **데이터를 발굴**하는 **ETL** 개발과 업무 **자동화** 프로젝트를 리딩하고 있습니다. 또한 빅데이터 기술은 누구나 활용할 수 있어야 한다는 생각으로, 구축과 연동 방법들을 개인 블로그에 공유하고 있습니다.<br>
  **스스로 문제를 정의**하고 해결하면서 **몰입과 성장**을 경험했습니다. 단순 반복 업무를 **자동화**하고 불필요한 프로세스의 개선을 통한 **업무 효율 향상**을 추구합니다. 늦게 시작한 만큼 더욱 치열하게 다양한 데이터와 기술을 경험하여, 기술 리더로 성장하는 데이터 엔지니어가 되고자 합니다.
